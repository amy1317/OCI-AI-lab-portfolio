# Lab 01 – Supervised Learning: Univariate Linear Regression

## **Purpose**
Implement and visualize a simple linear regression model using a single feature to predict a target variable. This demonstrates basic supervised learning concepts.

## **Contents**
- `univariate_linear_regression.ipynb` – Completed Jupyter Notebook
- `data.csv` – Dataset used in the exercise

## **Dataset**
A simple CSV dataset with one feature column (X) and one target column (Y) as provided in the workshop.

## **How to Run**
1. Open `univariate_linear_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Ensure `data.csv` is in the same folder.
3. Run all cells to train the model and view the regression plot.
