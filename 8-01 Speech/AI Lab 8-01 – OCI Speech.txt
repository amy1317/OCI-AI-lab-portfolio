# AI Labs – OCI Speech – Lab 8-01 – Practice

## Objective
Practice using the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Speech Service** to process audio data.  
This lab focuses on leveraging OCI Speech-to-Text and/or Text-to-Speech capabilities through the OCI Console or Playground.

## Steps
1. Log in to **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** Console.
2. Navigate to **AI Services > Speech**.
3. Open the **Speech Service Playground** or the relevant Speech interface.
4. Depending on the lab instructions, either:  
   - Upload or record audio files to convert speech to text, or  
   - Input text to generate synthesized speech audio.
5. Configure necessary parameters such as language, voice selection, audio format, or sampling rate.
6. Click **Run** or **Submit** to process the audio/text.
7. Review and analyze the output transcript or synthesized audio playback.
8. Optionally, experiment with different settings or sample inputs to observe effects on accuracy or audio quality.

## Output
- **Speech-to-Text:** You should see a text transcription of the uploaded or recorded audio.
- **Text-to-Speech:** You will receive an audio file or playback of synthesized voice reading the input text.
- Notes on transcription accuracy, recognition latency, or voice quality per your observations.

## Notes
- This lab primarily uses the OCI console web interface; no custom coding is required unless extending functionality via SDKs.
- You may want to note any challenges faced or key insights gained while using different voices or language settings.
- Optionally, you can mention if you tested the service on different audio qualities or languages.
