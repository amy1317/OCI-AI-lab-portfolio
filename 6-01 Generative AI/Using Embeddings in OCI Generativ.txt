# Using Embeddings in OCI Generative AI Playground

## Steps to Run Sentence Embeddings

1. **Open the Generative AI Playground in OCI Console**  
   Under the **Playground** section, click **Embedding**.

2. **Clear any existing input**  
   Click the **Clear** button.

3. **Select Your Model**  
   From the **Model** dropdown, choose: 
	cohere.embed-english-v3.0

4. **Add Sentences One by One**  
Copy and paste each sentence below **one at a time**, clicking the **Add sentence** button after each:

- I like apple.  
- I like cars.  
- I like bananas.  
- I do not like pears.  
- I like flying by plane.  
- I love pumpkin.  
- I like spinach.  

5. **Run the Embedding**  
Click **Run**.

6. **Analyze the Output Vector Projection**  
- Sentences with similar meaning are close to each other.  
  Example:  
    - Sentence 2: *I like cars*  
    - Sentence 5: *I like flying by plane*  
    These appear near each other because of similar sentiment.  

- Sentence 4 (*I do not like pears*) is farther away because of the “do not like” phrase.
